This repository includes all the scripts used in the article "[Plant nickel-exclusion versus hyperaccumulation: a microbial perspective](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40168-025-02098-7)". This paper explores via metabarcoding the microbiome of two endemic nickel-hyperaccumulator (Ni-HA) and non-accumulator (nA) species from New Caledonia: _Psychotria gabriellae_ (Pg, Ni-HA) and _Psychotria semperflorens_ (Ps, nA).

This repository is divided into two sections: one contains the scripts used for **bioinformatics processing**, and the other one includes the script and files required to run it for **statistical analyses**.
