This repertory includes all the scripts used in the article "**Nickel-Exclusion Versus Nickel-Hyperaccumulation: the Microbial Keystone?**". This paper explores via metabarcoding the microbiome of two endemic nickel-hyperaccumulator (Ni-HA) and non-accumulator (nA) species from New Caledonia: _Psychotria gabriellae_ (Pg, Ni-HA) and _Psychotria semperflorens_ (Ps, nA).

This repertory is divided into two sections: one contains the scripts used for **bioinformatics processing**, and the other includes the script and files required to run it for **statistical analyses**.
